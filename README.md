# Chacha20 Encryption for MAVLink on ArduPilot

This project implements the Chacha20 encryption algorithm and applies it to encrypt MAVLink communication in the ArduPilot system. The project includes a test file "test.encry.cpp" that simulates the encryption process with a sample MAVLink message.

# Project Overview
__. Chacha20 Algorithm:__ A fast and secure stream cipher used for encrypting and decrypting MAVLink communication data.  
__. MAVLink Data Simulation:__ "test.encry.cpp" simulates a MAVLink message and demonstrates the application and effect of Chacha20 encryption.
# Installation:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/timmychenhippo/Salsa20.git`
